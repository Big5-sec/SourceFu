Roadmap
-------
To be honest, there is so much to do that i can't write a roadmap at the moment....


Ideas
-----

core
~~~~
- always improve code support and deobfusactions routines!!!
- full interpretation : go further for loops and functions interpretation for example
- make analysis like vipermonkey, jsdetox, 
- functions inlining  
- spaghetti code simplification by basic block tagging
- add support for basic (autoit), and others?
- might be interesting to go further for another langages like python (beh bytecode editing?)
- might propose it to cuckoo when the tool will be quite correct?
- variables renaming based on context
- how to make the diff between optimization and vizualization of code?
- automatically determine if comments are helpful or not?
- automatically recovers elements caracterizing anti-debug and such
- support multiple languages in the same code, like for example when a VBA macro calls an obfuscated Powershell...
- support directly files instead of code (like office ones)
- code formatting and commenting  
- add tests, to serve as a basis and an improve point
- javascript support
- powershell support
- vba: object, tables, constant return functions and such  

API server
~~~~~~~~~~
- makes it more unified
- change languages and operations detection


web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- maybe separate it from api server
- full featured IDE like
- add more properties to the IDE, like direct interaction with picked token (renaming, invoking special routines, etc...)
- add plugins like VT, yara and such  


tests
~~~~~
- make tests for everything
- gather multiple samples on the web


documentation
